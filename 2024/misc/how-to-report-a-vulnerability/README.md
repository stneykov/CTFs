# How to report a vulnerability? (misc) (author: stn)

## Description

```shell
The Hacker Elf discovered a vulnerability in the Cyber Xmas website and he wants to contact the security team. However, there is no contact form there ðŸ˜± Find how to contact CyberXmas Securty Team and find your new flag!
```

## Task analysis & solution

We wandered blind for a while with this one, looking for a hidden contact form or some other obscure hint. Initially, the idea that someone would go through the trouble of creating a contact form and then hiding it seemed plausible. However, on reflection, this would defeat the purpose of having a contact form in the first place. After all, contacting site owners about security topics usually follows a well-established standard.

And there indeed is: https://github.com/securitytxt/security-txt

### What is security.txt?

security.txt provides a standardized way for websites to define their security policies. It serves as a clear guideline for security researchers on how to report security issues, functioning much like robots.txt, but specifically for security-related topics.

The main purpose of security.txt is to make it easier for both companies and security researchers to address potential vulnerabilities. With this file in place, researchers can quickly determine how to get in touch with companies regarding security concerns.

For websites, the security.txt file should be placed in one of the following locations:

- Preferred Location: /.well-known/security.txt

- Fallback Location: /security.txt (in the root directory of the website, if the /.well-known/ directory is not accessible for technical reasons).

WIth this newly found information, let's give https://cyberxmas.milestone.dk/.well-known/security.txt a try:
