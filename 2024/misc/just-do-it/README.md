## Task analysis & solution

Oh boy, this one really made us sweat. No files, no visible clues—just the poem and a nerve-wracking 3-attempt limit. Panic mode: engaged.

The challenge title, ``Just do it...``, tempted me to YOLO my three attempts right away. But something told me to pause—maybe it was my pride, maybe the thought of losing my points. Either way, I decided to investigate first.

I logged into the demo system on CTFd.io, hoping to find some kind of "reset attempts" magic button. Spoiler: no such feature exists (but hey, at least I didn't blow my chances irrationally).

Next, I stared at the poem for what felt like an eternity. Could the emojis mean something? 🎄💾 Was there some hidden pattern? Were the sleet and snowy trails a metaphor for my dwindling sanity? No confirmation.

One thing was clear: the challenge wasn't about brute-forcing the attempts. So, with a heavy heart (and an even heavier ego), I caved in and used the hint.

And there it was, the twist of all twists:

```
Congrats, you were brave enough to ask for help!

Here is the flag:

MilestoneCTF{its-not-a-shame-to-ask-for-help}

There is also a new challenge unlocked to compensate you for your sacrificed points :)
```

The flag was literally sitting there in the hint, peacefully waiting for me to stop being stubborn. Moral of the story? Sometimes, it’s really no shame to ask for help.
