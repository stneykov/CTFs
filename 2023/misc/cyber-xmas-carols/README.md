# Cyber Xmas Carols (misc)

## Description

```
We love to sing the Cyber Xmas Carols!

Probably you have already seen this flag, but now it's time to put it in the system. Some of you are trying to submit this flag since the annoucement of the Cyber Xmas! :)

Note: To make this more fun, please put this flag in reverse! i.e. MilestoneCTF{abc1234} -> MilestoneCTF{4321cba}

```

## Task analysis

The description of the task claims that we've already seen the flag and people have been trying to submit it **SINCE THE ANNOUNCEMENT** of the Cyber Xmas :) Truth is, we did have an announcement email that contained some interesting things, but let's see. Here's the content of that announcement email:

```

A whisper of mystery, in the festive sky!

## Solution

If we look closely at that poem, the second paragraph starts with an opening curly bracket and the last paragraph starts with a closing one. Reading the first letters on the few lines in between yields **{easy-flag}**. Now obviously that would be our flag. 

Now let's remember what the description of the task noted: the flag should be reversed. Thus we get **MilestoneCTF{galf-ysae}** and that would be the solution :)
